# NYH-Metadata-Exporter
 An exporter of metadata from New York Heritage's ContentDM instance.

This app is designed for a very specific purpose. It allows [New York Heritage](https://nyheritage.org/) (NYH) liaisons to export from NYH's instance of ContentDM the metadata associated with ESLN's council collections.  If you didn't understand some or all of that statement then this app isn't for you.

The app will download into a TSV the metadata from the selected aliases except for the **Description** and **Transcript** fields. This is done to make the TSV manageable ins size.
